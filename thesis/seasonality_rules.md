# Seasonality Rules & Heuristics

## U.S. Markets
*   **Presidential Cycle:** Midterm years are historically weak and volatile during the summer (Q2-Q3), often bottoming in October. Pre-election years are historically strong.
*   **Monthly Trends:** 
    *   November to April: Historically the strongest six months.
    *   May to October: Historically weak ("Sell in May").
    *   September: Statistically the worst performing month.
*   **Tax Loss Harvesting:** Watch for tax-loss selling pressure in Nov/Dec, often leading to a bounce in January.

## Global Equity Markets
*   **Australia (ASX):** Strong performance historically expected in July due to the July 1st start of their financial year and fresh capital deployment.
*   **Europe:** Strong "Halloween Effect" (Nov-Apr outperformance).

## Commodities (Gold)
*   **Diwali (India):** Late Q3 / Early Q4. Look for a seasonal tailwind in Gold due to physical demand for the festival.
*   **Lunar New Year (Asia):** Late January / February. Expect physical demand surges supporting Gold prices early in the calendar year.
