# Macroeconomic View

**Current Posture:** Cautiously Optimistic, Volatility Aware, Navigating Political & Currency Shifts

## 1. The Political Landscape (Trump Impact)
*   **Thesis:** A Trump administration or heavily influenced policy environment is considered a net negative for the broader economy in our model.
*   **Validation & Context:** This thesis is grounded in the economic risks of aggressive protectionism (tariffs acting as a regressive tax, sparking retaliatory trade wars that hurt multi-nationals), potential threats to Federal Reserve independence, and deficit-financed tax cuts in a high-interest-rate environment. This typically leads to a steeper yield curve (higher long-term borrowing costs) and sustained inflationary pressures.
*   **Actionable Strategy:** Underweight consumer discretionary reliant on cheap imports; overweight domestic industrial bases or defense if geopolitical tensions rise.

## 2. Currency Dynamics (USD & De-dollarization)
*   **Thesis:** De-dollarization is a real narrative, but practically, "TINA" (There Is No Alternative) applies to the U.S. Dollar as the global reserve currency.
*   **Validation & Context:** While BRICS+ nations are attempting bilateral trade in local currencies or accumulating gold to bypass the SWIFT system, no other currency has the liquidity, rule of law, and open capital markets to replace the USD. The Euro is politically fragmented, and the Chinese Yuan has strict capital controls. 
*   **Actionable Strategy:** Continue to price global assets primarily in USD. Do not panic-sell US assets on "death of the dollar" news. However, maintain a strategic Gold position as a hedge against the *friction* caused by this slow de-dollarization trend, particularly driven by Asian central bank buying.

## Key Metrics to Monitor
*   **Federal Reserve Funds Rate:** Are we in a hiking, pausing, or cutting cycle?
*   **CPI & PCE (Inflation):** If inflation re-accelerates, growth stocks (Tech) will likely suffer as bond yields rise.
*   **10-Year Treasury Yield:** Serves as the "risk-free" hurdle rate. Yields > 4.5% generally pressure equity valuations.
*   **U.S. Dollar Index (DXY):** A strong dollar hurts multi-national corporate earnings and emerging markets. A weakening dollar is generally bullish for global equities and commodities (like Gold).

## General Guidelines
*   In periods of rising rates, prefer value and defensive sectors (Healthcare, Staples, Energy).
*   In periods of falling rates, prefer growth and technology.
*   Watch international markets for relative strength if U.S. markets are consolidating.
