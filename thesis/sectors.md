# Sector Preferences & Verticals

## 1. Technology & AI (The Hype Cycle vs. Infrastructure)
*   **Thesis 1 - AI is Overhyped:** The broad application layer of AI (startups wrapping GPT wrappers) is deeply overvalued and facing a severe reality check as monetization struggles to match infrastructure costs. 
*   **Thesis 2 - The "Shovel Sellers" (NVDA):** Despite the application hype, infrastructure build-out is a physical necessity that precedes software revenue. Nvidia (NVDA) has a strong moat and a ~1-year runway of massive data center CAPEX spending from hyperscalers before demand potentially normalizes or competition (AMD, custom ASICs) catches up.
*   **Thesis 3 - The "SaaS Apocalypse" is Too Bearish:** The narrative that AI will entirely replace traditional SaaS (Software as a Service) companies is overstated. Enterprise software benefits from massive switching costs, high integration, and data gravity. Existing SaaS giants are more likely to integrate AI as a feature (Copilots) and increase ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) rather than be replaced by zero-UI AI agents overnight.
*   **Strategy:** Hold/trade NVDA strategically for the next 6-12 months but keep tight trailing stops. Accumulate beaten-down, high-quality traditional SaaS companies with strong free cash flow and sticky enterprise customer bases. Avoid unprofitable AI application startups.

## 2. Financials (Value & Yield)
*   **Focus:** Large-cap U.S. and Canadian Banks.
*   **Strategy:** Accumulate near book value. Good for covered call strategies to generate yield during sideways markets.

## 3. Energy & Commodities (Inflation Hedge)
*   **Focus:** Oil & Gas producers, Gold (Physical or Miners).
*   **Strategy:** Energy is a hedge against geopolitical shocks. Gold is a hedge against currency debasement and a play on Asian seasonal demand.

## 4. International Equities (Diversification)
*   **Focus:** Canada (TSX), Australia (ASX), Europe.
*   **Strategy:** Look for periods where international markets show relative strength compared to the S&P 500, especially taking advantage of unique fiscal calendars (e.g., Australia in July).
